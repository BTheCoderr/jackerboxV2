## 3. Database Migrations

```
DATABASE_URL="your-production-db-connection-string"
```

2. Run the Prisma migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

3. Generate the Prisma client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## 4. Build and Test

1. Build the production version:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Test the production build locally:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Verify all features work correctly:
   - [ ] User authentication
   - [ ] Equipment management
   - [ ] Rental process
   - [ ] Reviews & ratings
   - [ ] Messaging system
   - [ ] Notifications
   - [ ] Search & discovery
   - [ ] Admin features

## 5. Platform Selection

- [ ] Netlify
- [ ] AWS Amplify
- [ ] Digital Ocean App Platform
- [ ] Self-hosted (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)

## 6. Domain and SSL

- [ ] Purchase a domain name (e.g., jackerbox.com)

- [ ] Set up SSL certificate (often automatic with platforms like Vercel/Netlify)

## 7. CI/CD Configuration

- [ ] Check email delivery and notifications

## 10. Launch

- [ ] Switch payment processing to live mode

- [ ] Gather feedback and prepare for iterative improvements

## 11. Post-Launch

- [ ] Set up regular database backups
- [ ] Create a monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Establish a process for deploying updates
