# Cloudinary Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

We've created a comprehensive Cloudinary integration for your Jackerbox application, which includes:

1. **Cloudinary Upload Hook** (`src/hooks/use-cloudinary-upload.ts`)
   - Custom React hook for direct browser-to-Cloudinary uploads
   - Progress tracking and error handling
   - Support for folders, tags, and transformations

2. **Cloudinary Upload Component** (`src/components/ui/cloudinary-upload.tsx`)
   - Drag-and-drop file upload interface
   - Multiple file support
   - Progress visualization
   - File preview after upload

3. **Cloudinary Image Components** (`src/components/ui/cloudinary-image.tsx`)
   - `CloudinaryImage`: Responsive image component with automatic optimization
   - `CloudinaryBlurImage`: Progressive loading with blur-up effect
   - Support for various transformations (crop, resize, effects)

4. **API Endpoint for Secure Uploads** (`src/app/api/upload/cloudinary-signature/route.ts`)
   - Generates signed upload parameters for secure direct uploads
   - User authentication and request validation
   - Support for custom upload parameters

5. **Setup Script** (`scripts/setup-cloudinary.ts`)
   - Interactive setup for Cloudinary credentials
   - Automatic .env file configuration
   - Creation of upload presets for different content types
   - Connection testing

## How to Use

### 1. Setup Cloudinary

Run the setup script to configure your Cloudinary account:

```bash
npm run setup-cloudinary
```

This will:
- Prompt for your Cloudinary credentials
- Update your .env file
- Test the connection
- Create upload presets for different content types

### 2. Upload Files

Use the CloudinaryUpload component in your React components:

```jsx
import { CloudinaryUpload } from '@/components/ui/cloudinary-upload';

function MyComponent() {
  const handleUploadComplete = (files) => {
    console.log('Uploaded files:', files);
    // Do something with the uploaded files
  };

  return (
    <CloudinaryUpload
      onUploadComplete={handleUploadComplete}
      folder="equipment"
      tags={['rental', 'equipment']}
      multiple={true}
    />
  );
}
```

### 3. Display Images

Use the CloudinaryImage component to display optimized images:

```jsx
import { CloudinaryImage } from '@/components/ui/cloudinary-image';

function ProductImage({ publicId }) {
  return (
    <CloudinaryImage
      publicId={publicId}
      alt="Product image"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      crop="fill"
      gravity="auto"
      quality="auto"
      format="auto"
      responsive={true}
    />
  );
}
```

For progressive loading with blur effect:

```jsx
import { CloudinaryBlurImage } from '@/components/ui/cloudinary-image';

function ProductImage({ publicId }) {
  return (
    <CloudinaryBlurImage
      publicId={publicId}
      alt="Product image"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      crop="fill"
    />
  );
}
```
