# JackerBox Implementation Plan

## Core Functionality Testing

### User Flows
1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test signup flow with email validation
   - Test login with email/password
   - Test social login (Google, Apple)
   - Test profile management (updating user info, changing password)
   - Test phone verification flow

2. **Equipment Management**
   - Test creating equipment listings
   - Test uploading images to Cloudinary
   - Test editing and deleting listings
   - Test availability calendar functionality
   - Test search and filtering of equipment

3. **Booking & Rental Management**
   - Test booking flow from start to finish
   - Test payment processing with Stripe
   - Test security deposit handling
   - Test rental status management (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
   - Test rental reviews

4. **Notifications & Messaging**
   - Test in-app notifications system
   - Test email notifications for key events
   - Test push notifications (if implemented)
   - Test messaging between renters and owners

## Webhook Configuration

1. **Stripe Webhooks**
   - Configure webhook endpoints in Stripe Dashboard
   - Set up event listeners for payment events:
     - `payment_intent.succeeded`
     - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
     - `payout.created`
     - `charge.dispute.created`
   - Set proper webhook signing secret in environment variables
   - Test each webhook with Stripe CLI or test events

2. **Stripe Identity Webhooks**
   - Configure identity verification webhooks
   - Set up event listeners for:
     - `identity.verification_session.verified`
     - `identity.verification_session.requires_input`
   - Test identity verification flow

3. **Other Service Webhooks**
   - Set up any other third-party service webhooks (if applicable)
   - Test all webhook integrations with valid test events

## Performance & Scalability

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Review schema for proper indexing (already have indexes on foreign keys)
   - Add additional indexes for frequently queried fields:
     ```prisma
     @@index([category])
     @@index([isAvailable, moderationStatus])
     @@index([location])
     ```
   - Implement pagination for list endpoints
   - Optimize query patterns for common operations

2. **Caching Implementation**
   - Leverage Redis for caching frequently accessed data:
     - Equipment listings cache
     - User profile cache
     - Search results cache
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies
   - Add cache headers for static assets (already in middleware)

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Set up error tracking with a service like Sentry
   - Implement logging for critical operations
   - Create custom metrics for important business events
   - Set up alerts for system issues

4. **Auto-scaling Configuration**
   - Configure Vercel scaling settings
   - Implement database connection pooling
   - Ensure Redis connections are properly managed

## Testing Strategy

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Complete user flow testing
   - Test on multiple devices and browsers
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Add unit tests for critical components
   - Implement integration tests for key flows
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

3. **Load Testing**
   - Test application under load
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Implement fixes for performance issues

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)
- Enhance search and filtering
- Improve booking flow
- Implement basic review system

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)
- Add availability calendar
- Implement real-time chat
- Enhance notification system

### Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)
- Improve image management
- Develop rating algorithm
- Create messaging center

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write tests for all new API endpoints
   - Test edge cases for booking logic
   - Validate rating calculations

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test end-to-end booking flows
   - Verify real-time messaging
   - Test notification delivery

3. **Beta Testing**:
   - Use pre-created test accounts
   - Follow scenarios in the beta testing guide
   - Collect feedback on new features

## Resources Needed

1. **Firebase** (already configured):
   - Use Firestore for real-time chat
   - Leverage Firebase Authentication for user management

2. **AWS Services** (already configured):
   - S3 for image storage
   - Rekognition for image moderation

3. **Frontend Libraries**:
   - React Calendar for availability display
   - Socket.io for real-time communication
   - React Dropzone for image uploads (already implemented)

## Getting Started

To begin implementing these features:

1. Run the beta testing environment setup:
   ```
   node scripts/setup-beta-environment.js
   ```

2. Start with the highest priority features:
   - Availability calendar
   - Real-time chat
   - Enhanced search and filtering

3. Test each feature with the pre-created test accounts
