# Jackerbox Implementation Summary

This document provides an overview of the features implemented for the Jackerbox platform, focusing on the recent additions to meet the MVP requirements.

## Implemented Features

### 1. ID Verification System

We've implemented a cost-effective ID verification system with the following components:

- **Basic OCR Verification**: Using Tesseract.js for text extraction from ID documents
- **Pattern Matching**: Identifying document types and extracting key information
- **Manual Review Process**: Admin interface for reviewing verification requests
- **Notification System**: Alerts for both users and admins about verification status

This approach provides a free alternative to paid verification services while still offering reasonable security. The system can be upgraded to a paid service once the platform generates revenue.
