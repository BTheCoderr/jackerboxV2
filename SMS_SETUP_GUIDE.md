Your SMS infrastructure is **ready and working**! Here's what's been implemented:

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/auth/send-verification` and `/api/auth/verify-code` are created
- **Phone Verification Library**: Twilio integration is implemented

- **Test Mode**: Development mode with test phone numbers works
- **Environment Variables**: Twilio configuration is detected

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue
Your Twilio phone number `+18445520447` is not SMS-capable. This is a simple Twilio configuration issue.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Get an SMS-Capable Twilio Phone Number

**Option A: Upgrade Your Current Number**
1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Navigate to **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí **Manage** ‚Üí **Active numbers**
3. Click on your number `+18445520447`
4. Check if SMS is enabled in the capabilities
5. If not, you may need to upgrade or get a new number

**Option B: Get a New SMS-Capable Number**
1. In Twilio Console, go to **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí **Manage** ‚Üí **Buy a number**
2. Select your country (United States)
3. Check **SMS** in the capabilities filter
4. Choose a number and purchase it ($1/month typically)
5. Update your `.env.local` with the new number:
   ```
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1YOURNEWNUMBER
   ```

### 2. Test SMS Functionality

Once you have an SMS-capable number:

```bash
# Test the SMS system
node scripts/test-sms.js
```

### 3. Test in the App

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the login page: `http://localhost:3000/auth/login`
3. Try these test scenarios:

**Test Phone Numbers (Development Mode):**
- `+15555555555` - Always works with code `123456`
- `+12025550123` - Always works with code `123456`

**Real Phone Number:**
- Enter your actual phone number
- You should receive a real SMS with a 6-digit code

## How It Works

### Development Mode
- Test phone numbers automatically work
- No real SMS is sent
- Verification code is always `123456`
- Perfect for testing without using SMS credits

### Production Mode
- Real SMS messages are sent via Twilio
- 6-digit verification codes are generated
- Codes expire after 10 minutes

### API Flow
1. User enters phone number ‚Üí `/api/auth/send-verification`
2. System generates code and sends SMS via Twilio
3. User enters code ‚Üí `/api/auth/verify-code`
4. System verifies code and signs user in

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are in your `.env.local`:

```env
# SMS/Phone Verification (Twilio)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_sms_capable_phone_number
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Phone number is not message-capable"
- Your Twilio number doesn't support SMS
- Solution: Get an SMS-capable number (see steps above)

### "Invalid credentials" in Twilio
- Check your Account SID and Auth Token
- Make sure they're correctly set in `.env.local`

### "No account found with this phone number"
- The user needs to register first with their phone number
- Or they need to add their phone number to their existing account

### SMS not received
- Check if the phone number format is correct (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
- Verify the Twilio number is SMS-capable
- Check Twilio logs in the console for delivery status
